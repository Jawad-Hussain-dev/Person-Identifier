#  Person Identifier using HOG + Decision Tree

This project implements a lightweight and interpretable **Person Identification System** using **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** features and a **Decision Tree Classifier**. Built for the course *Introduction to Computaional Thinking*, the focus is on explainability, interpretability, and modular thinking.

##  Project Goals

- Apply **Computational Thinking (CT)** principles:
  - Decomposition
  - Pattern Recognition
  - Abstraction
  - Algorithmic Thinking
- Use **HOG** to extract meaningful facial features
- Train a **Decision Tree** classifier for clear, explainable predictions
- Provide a **GUI** for user-friendly testing of predictions
- Visualize decision paths and most important features for interpretability

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jawad-Hussain-dev/Person-Identifier.git
cd Person-Identifier
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or manually:

```bash
pip install opencv-python scikit-image scikit-learn matplotlib pillow joblib
```

### 3. Train the model

```bash
python train2.py
```

This builds the dataset, trains the Decision Tree, and saves it .

### 4. Launch the GUI

```bash
python gui_predict.py
```

Use the GUI to:

* Upload an image
* Get the predicted person ID
* See the decision path
* View the original + HOG visualizations

##  Sample Output

*  Accuracy: 97.4%
*  Model: Decision Tree (depth=10)
*  Explanation: Decision path and top features
*  GUI: HOG + Original image display side-by-side

##  CT Principles in Action

| Principle            | Application                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Decomposition        | Separated modules for extraction, training, GUI |
| Pattern Recognition  | HOG identifies facial structure & orientation   |
| Abstraction          | Faces turned into numeric feature vectors       |
| Algorithmic Thinking | Decision Tree rules used to predict & explain   |
