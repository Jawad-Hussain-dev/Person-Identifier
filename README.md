#  Person Identifier using HOG + Decision Tree

This project implements a lightweight and interpretable **Person Identification System** using **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** features and a **Decision Tree Classifier**. Built for the course *Introduction to Computaional Thinking*, the focus is on explainability, interpretability, and modular thinking.

##  Project Goals

- Apply **Computational Thinking (CT)** principles:
  - Decomposition
  - Pattern Recognition
  - Abstraction
  - Algorithmic Thinking
- Use **HOG** to extract meaningful facial features
- Train a **Decision Tree** classifier for clear, explainable predictions
- Provide a **GUI** for user-friendly testing of predictions
- Visualize decision paths and most important features for interpretability

##  CT Principles in Action

| Principle            | Application                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Decomposition        | Separated modules for extraction, training, GUI |
| Pattern Recognition  | HOG identifies facial structure & orientation   |
| Abstraction          | Faces turned into numeric feature vectors       |
| Algorithmic Thinking | Decision Tree rules used to predict & explain   |
